	Analyzed LDR values and fine-tuned thresholdÂ andÂ timing


 # Arduino Li-Fi Temperature Transmission (Single Board)

This project demonstrates how to transmit temperature data using visible light, through a simple setup involving one Arduino UNO board. The system uses a DHT11 temperature sensor, an LED as a transmitter, and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) as a receiver.

---

## Project Summary

- **Objective**: Send temperature data as light signals (1s and 0s) using an LED and detect them with an LDR, all using a single Arduino.
- **Approach**: Convert temperature readings into binary and transmit each bit by blinking an LED. The LDR detects light intensity changes and reconstructs the binary data.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO
- DHT11 Temperature Sensor
- 1 x LED (transmitting light)
- 1 x LDR (light detection)
- 10kÎ© resistor (for voltage divider with LDR)
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- USB cable and Arduino IDE

---

## How It Works

1. The Arduino reads the temperature using the DHT11 sensor.
2. It converts the temperature (e.g., 34Â°C) to ASCII characters (e.g., '3' and '4').
3. Each character is converted to 8-bit binary.
4. For each bit:
   - If bit is 1 â†’ LED is turned ON
   - If bit is 0 â†’ LED is turned OFF
5. While the LED transmits, the LDR reads brightness values multiple times.
6. The program compares LDR average against a threshold to decide if a 1 or 0 was received.
7. Bits are reconstructed to form the original temperature and printed to the Serial Monitor.
